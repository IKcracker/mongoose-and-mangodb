# Mongoose User Schema with Pre-Save Hook Example

## Introduction

This repository serves as an example of utilizing Mongoose, a popular MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, to create a user schema with a pre-save hook. The pre-save hook allows for custom validation or manipulation of data before saving it to the database. In this example, we implement a pre-save hook to prevent saving duplicate user documents based on their names.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 10 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (running locally or accessible via a remote URI)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mongoose-user-schema.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd mongoose-user-schema
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine or is accessible via a remote URI.

2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. Open your terminal to view the output messages, which indicate the status of the MongoDB connection and the actions taken with the user schema.

## Detailed Overview

- `index.js`: This file serves as the entry point of the application. It defines the Mongoose schema for the user, including the pre-save hook. Additionally, it contains the logic for connecting to MongoDB, creating a user instance, calling the `display` method, and attempting to save the user instance.

- `package.json`: The package.json file contains metadata about the project, including dependencies. It lists the required npm packages for this project.
